		<h1>Side-Eye</h1>
		<h2 class = "main_about">What is Side-Eye about?</h2>
			<div class="blockschrift">The idea of this project was to implement an app, which allows the user to track a trip or rather their commute. After completing the tracking the app will then show them what interesting places they passed and missed while they were on the go. Currently the app only supports restaurants and places of worship in the city of zurich, but it could theoretically be extended to support other points of interest (POIs) as well.
			</div>
		<h2 class = "main_about"> How to use Side-Eye</h2>
			<div class="blockschrift">To get started, ensure that your device is connected to the ETH VPN if you are not within the ETH network. Due to the implementation with a vercel-server you can use all functionalities through the website (no need to use localhost). As default-data there is a pre-recorded example-trip you can test the app with. Alternatively, you can go out and explore the city of zurich by recording new trips on the maps-page. As soon as you start recording you'll see a blinking red dot appear in the upper right corner of your screen.
			</div>

			<div class="blockschrift">If you see something remarkable you want to be able to find again easily, you can mark points in tracking mode. Later in the visualisation of your trips, these points will be marked and help you to identify which POIs you spotted and wanted to remember.
			</div>

			<div class="blockschrift">After pressing the stop-button, a window pops up in which you can enter the name and transport mode of your trip and upload it to the database. But beware, the data can only be loaded into the database if at least 2 points have been recorded.  Now the app switches from the map page to your commutes, where you should see your newly recorded trip. After clicking on your trip, you can choose if you would like to see the restaurants or places of worship along your route.
			</div>

		<h2 class = "main_about"> Who is the Side-Eye Team</h2>
