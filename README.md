# SIDE-EYE

## Introduction
Side-Eye is a semesterproject in the lecture GTA from Carlos, Christian, Estelle and Niklas.

Link to the public [GitHubRepository](https://github.com/blc460/GTA8) with all the code. (Not necessary for users only for grading)

## How to use the app?
The app is shared under the following [URL](https://n.ethz.ch/~cblase/gta/index.html). Due to the implementation with vercel you can use all functionalitis through the website (no ned to share flask on localhost). As Default there is an example-trip you can test or you go out and explore the city of zurich by recording new trips on the maps page. As soon as you start recording a new trip you'll see a blinking red dot on the top left of your device.

After you press the stop-button you'll see a popup window in which you can give more detail to your trip and save it to the database. Now the app switches from the map page to your commutes, here you should see your newly recorded trip. By clicking on your trip, you can choose if you would like to see restaurants or places of worship.
